# Day 1 - NumPy Basics

## What I Learned
- Basic array creation with `np.array()`
- Difference between Python lists and NumPy arrays
- Multi-dimensional arrays (vectors and matrices)
- Array generation functions

## Files
- `num.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with NumPy basics exercises and outputs

## Key Concepts
- Lists can store multiple data types, arrays convert to uniform type
- Arrays support multi-dimensional operations
- NumPy arrays are more efficient than Python lists for numerical computations
